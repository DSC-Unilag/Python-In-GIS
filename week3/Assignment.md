# 1st Assignment

Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, email and phone number.

* Ensure the name only contains alphabets and/or whitespace for writing more than one name
* Ensure that the email contains a @ and . character
* Ensure the age contains only numbers
* Ensure the phone number only contains numbers and starts with 0

Print the data following the format
* If the person's name has more than 10 characters, print the name and tell them they have a long name, if they don't just print the name
* Print the email
* If the person is under 18, tell them they are a minor and print their age, if they are more than 18 just print the age

# 2nd Assignment

Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements.

Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

* If n is odd, print Weird</br>
* If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird</br>
* If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird</br>
* If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird</br>

### Explanation

Sample Case 0: n = 3</br>
 * n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.</br>
Sample Case 1: n = 24</br>
 * n  > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.</br>

# 3rd Assignment 

Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

Task
Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n * i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

### Input Format

A single integer, n.



### Sample Output

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
