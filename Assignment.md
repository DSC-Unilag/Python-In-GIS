# 2nd Assignment

Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements.

Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird</br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird</br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird</br>
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird</br>

### Explanation

Sample Case 0: n = 3</br>
 * n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.</br>
Sample Case 1: n = 24</br>
 * n  > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.</br>
